# The Modelix Project
The modelix project develops an open source platform for (meta-)models on the web. We are native to the web and the cloud.

For general information on modelix, please refer to the [official modelix homepage](https://modelix.org) as well as the [platform documentation](https://docs.modelix.org).

For individual component specific documentation, see https://docs.modelix.org/modelix/latest/reference/components.html

# modelix.core

## Development

### Commit convention

This project uses [conventional commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as the convention for Git commits.

### pre-commit

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to validate that new commits follow intended conventions.
To enable pre-commit hooks, you have to run the following command initially after cloning the repository:

```console
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Some checks use by pre-commit are implemented by JavaScript components.
Therefore, it's necessary to have the required packages installed via:

```console
$ npm install
added 72 packages, removed 98 packages, changed 203 packages, and audited 654 packages in 3s
...
```
