= How-To Run the Light `model-server` in MPS as a Plugin
:navtitle: `mps-model-server-plugin`


You can run a *light version* of the `model-server` directly in MPS via the dedicated *MPS as Modelix Model Server Plugin*, which is published over at the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22834-mps-as-modelix-model-server[JetBrains Marketplace^].

NOTE: More information on the component in general can be found in the xref:core:reference/component-mps-model-server-plugin.adoc[corresponding component reference].

[IMPORTANT]
====
A light model-server does not provide the full features as an independent `model-server` instance will.
More *advanced features* will not work with this light version (e.g., modelix specific repositories/branches, or the xref:howto/metrics.adoc[metrics]).

If you want the full capabilities of the `model-server`, check out xref:howto/usage-model-api-gen-gradle.adoc[how to start it standalone].

== How to Install the Plugin

In MPS navigate to menu:File[Settings > Plugins (left) > Marketplace (top)].
