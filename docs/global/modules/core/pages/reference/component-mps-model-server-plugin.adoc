== Health checks

The plugin offers a set of health checks via HTTP on port 48305 and path `/health`.
Health checks can be enabled adding query parameters with the health check name and the value `true` to the request.

=== indexer

The check fails, if the indexer is currently running for one of the opened projects.

[NOTE]
====
This check indicates a healthy system until a project is opened.
Combine it with the `projects` health check to effectively wait for the system to be ready to serve data immediately.
====

=== projects

Reports an unhealthy system whenever no project is loaded.

=== virtualFolders

Reports an unhealthy system when no virtual folders are available.
This might also be true in case a project without virtual folders is fully loaded.
