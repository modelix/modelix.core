// Tests for a model client that cannot run in isolation.
// One such case is starting a server and using the model client from JS at the same time.
// This integration tests start a mock server with Docker Compose.
//
// They are in a subproject so that they can be easily run in isolation or be excluded.
// An alternative to a separate project would be to have a custom compilation.
// I failed to configure custom compilation, and for now, subproject was a more straightforward configuration.
// See https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-configure-compilations.html#create-a-custom-compilation
//
// Using docker compose to startup containers with Gradle is not ideal.
// Ideally, each test should do the setup it needs by themselves.
// A good solution would be https://testcontainers.com/.
// But there is no unified Kotlin Multiplatform API and no REST API
// to start containers from web browser executing tests.
// The solution with Docker Compose works for now
// because the number of tests is small and only one container configuration is enough.
