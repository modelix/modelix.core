/**
 * This interface is meant exclusively for model client usage.
 *
 * It is designed to ensure decoupling between model client usage operations and other aspects,
 * such as lifecycle management.
 * Users of this interface cannot incidentally depend on non-usage functionality.
 * See also: [Interface segregation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
 *
 * Specifically, this interface should not be used for managing the client's lifecycle,
 * as the lifecycle management may vary depending on the specific implementation.
 * If you need to manage the client's lifecycle, use the methods in the class interface of the concrete implementations,
 * such as [ModelClientV2].
