/**
 * Keeps a local replica of the model in sync with the remote model.
 * Changes can be made concurrently and are merged with changes made by other clients.
 *
 * # Algorithm
 * When local changes are made, they are pushed to the server and the server merges them into the remote model.
 * In contrast to Git, a push will not be rejected if the client didn't pull the latest remote version first,
 * but the server will just handle the merge and respond with the merged version.
 *
 * When the response from the server is received there are two cases:
 * - 1. nothing changed locally and the local copy can just be replaced with the received version
 * - 2. the local copy changed again, in which case we have to options:
 *   - A. merge the received version with the local version
 *   - B. ignore the received version and just push the new local changes, hoping that case 1 will apply this time.
 *
 * Option A potentially has to fetch additional data from the server to do a correct merge. This can result in a bigger
 * delay than just letting the server do the merge (option B). The server is located closer to the data and usually can
 * do the merge faster.
 * In case of a JavaScript client it's especially preferred to avoid additional requests. It doesn't support blocking
 * calls and not all code is consistently using async/stream APIs yet.
 *
 * Option B can be problematic in scenarios with a high frequency of concurrent changes. Then the merge algorithm will
 * repeatedly enter case 2 and continue to diverge. It relies on a large enough delay between local changes.
 * This is mostly theoretical and not expected cause any issues in practice.
 *
 * A previous implementation used strategy A, but was changed to strategy B to fix issues in the JS client.
 *
 * Dispose should be called on this, as otherwise a regular polling will go on.
 *
 * @property client the model client to connect to the model server
 * @property branchRef the model server branch to fetch the data from
 * @property providedScope the CoroutineScope to use for the suspendable tasks
 * @property initialRemoteVersion the last version on the server from which we want to start the synchronization
