     * The order also ensures three properties:
     * 1. The versions are ordered topologically starting with the versions without parents.
     * 2. The order is also "monotonic".
     *    This means adding a version to the set of all versions will never change
     *    the order of versions that were previously in the history.
     *    For example, given versions 1, 2 and 3:
     *      If 1 and 2 are ordered as (1, 2), ordering 1, 2 and 3 will never produce (2, 3, 1).
     *      3 can come anywhere (respecting the topological ordering), but 2 has to come after 1.
     * 3. "Close versions are kept together"
     *    Formally: A version that has only one child (ignoring) should always come before the child.
     *      Example: 1 <- 2 <- 3 and 1 <- x, then [1, 2, 4, 3] is not allowed,
     *      because 3 is the only child of 2.
     *      Valid orders would be (1, x, 3, 4) and (1, x, 2, 3)
     *    This is relevant for UnduOp and RedoOp.
     *    See UndoTest.
